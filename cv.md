## About me
I've started studying web-development not so long ago and I am not very good at it by far. But since the time I've started my education, I'm learning new things every day, and I really like it. I'm doing my best and I hope to succeed in becoming a demand front-end developer. I think this is a great opportunity for me to develop my personal and professional skills. Programming has power to change the world and people's lives to better.

## Skills
- JavaScript (ES6, React, Redux)
- HTML5/CSS3
- REST APIs
- Git
- VS Code

# Code example
```
function isPalindrome(line) {
  return line == line.toString().split('').reverse().join('');
}
```
